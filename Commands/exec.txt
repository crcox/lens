  eexxeecc?switches? arg?arg ...?

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

  This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or more
  subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a standard shell
  pipeline where each arg becomes one word of a command, and each distinct
  command becomes a subprocess.

  If the initial arguments to eexxeecc start with -- then they are treated as
  command-line switches and are not part of the pipeline specification. The
  following switches are currently supported:



    --kkeeeeppnneewwlliinnee
        Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output. Normally a
        trailing newline will be deleted.

    -- --
        Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
        treated as the first arg even if it starts with a --.


  If an arg (or pair of arg's) has one of the forms described below then it
  is used by eexxeecc to control the flow of input and output among the
  subprocess(es). Such arguments will not be passed to the subprocess(es). In
  forms such as ``< fileName'' fileName may either be in a separate argument
  from ``<'' or in the same argument with no intervening space (i.e.
  ``<fileName'').



    |
        Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. The standard output of
        the preceding command will be piped into the standard input of the
        next command.

    |&
        Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. Both standard output and
        standard error of the preceding command will be piped into the
        standard input of the next command. This form of redirection
        overrides forms such as 2> and >&.

    < fileName
        The file named by fileName is opened and used as the standard input
        for the first command in the pipeline.

    <@ fileId
        FileId must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
        value from a previous call to _oo_pp_ee_nn. It is used as the standard input
        for the first command in the pipeline. FileId must have been opened
        for reading.

    << value
        Value is passed to the first command as its standard input.

    > fileName
        Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file named
        fileName, overwriting its previous contents.

    2> fileName
        Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the
        file named fileName, overwriting its previous contents.

    >& fileName
        Both standard output from the last command and standard error from
        all commands are redirected to the file named fileName, overwriting
        its previous contents.

    >> fileName
        Standard output from the last command is redirected to the file named
        fileName, appending to it rather than overwriting it.

    2>> fileName
        Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the
        file named fileName, appending to it rather than overwriting it.

    >>& fileName
        Both standard output from the last command and standard error from
        all commands are redirected to the file named fileName, appending to
        it rather than overwriting it.

    >@ fileId
        FileId must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
        value from a previous call to _oo_pp_ee_nn. Standard output from the last
        command is redirected to fileId's file, which must have been opened
        for writing.

    2>@ fileId
        FileId must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
        value from a previous call to _oo_pp_ee_nn. Standard error from all commands
        in the pipeline is redirected to fileId's file. The file must have
        been opened for writing.

    >&@ fileId
        FileId must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
        value from a previous call to _oo_pp_ee_nn. Both standard output from the
        last command and standard error from all commands are redirected to
        fileId's file. The file must have been opened for writing.


  If standard output has not been redirected then the eexxeecc command returns
  the standard output from the last command in the pipeline. If any of the
  commands in the pipeline exit abnormally or are killed or suspended, then
  eexxeecc will return an error and the error message will include the pipeline's
  output followed by error messages describing the abnormal terminations; the
  eerrrroorrCCooddee variable will contain additional information about the last
  abnormal termination encountered. If any of the commands writes to its
  standard error file and that standard error isn't redirected, then eexxeecc
  will return an error; the error message will include the pipeline's
  standard output, followed by messages about abnormal terminations (if any),
  followed by the standard error output.

  If the last character of the result or error message is a newline then that
  character is normally deleted from the result or error message. This is
  consistent with other Tcl return values, which don't normally end with
  newlines. However, if --kkeeeeppnneewwlliinnee is specified then the trailing newline
  is retained.

  If standard input isn't redirected with ``<'' or ``<<'' or ``<@'' then the
  standard input for the first command in the pipeline is taken from the
  application's current standard input.

  If the last arg is ``&'' then the pipeline will be executed in background.
  In this case the eexxeecc command will return a list whose elements are the
  process identifiers for all of the subprocesses in the pipeline. The
  standard output from the last command in the pipeline will go to the
  application's standard output if it hasn't been redirected, and error
  output from all of the commands in the pipeline will go to the
  application's standard error file unless redirected.

  The first word in each command is taken as the command name; tilde-
  substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains no slashes then
  the directories in the PATH environment variable are searched for an
  executable by the given name. If the name contains a slash then it must
  refer to an executable reachable from the current directory. No ``_g_l_o_b''
  expansion or other shell-like substitutions are performed on the arguments
  to commands.

        Reading from or writing to a socket, using the ``@@fileId'' notation,
        does not work. When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application
        will hang and a 32-bit application will return immediately with end-
        of-file. When either type of application writes to a socket, the
        information is instead sent to the console, if one is present, or is
        discarded.

        The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO
        capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
        applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information
        redirected to standard output or standard error will be discarded.

        Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path separators
        for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an application, the
        path name specified for the application may also contain forward or
        backward slashes as path separators. Bear in mind, however, that most
        Windows applications accept arguments with forward slashes only as
        option delimiters and backslashes only in paths. Any arguments to an
        application that specify a path name with forward slashes will not
        automatically be converted to use the backslash character. If an
        argument contains forward slashes as the path separator, it may or
        may not be recognized as a path name, depending on the program.

        Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X application,
        all path names must use the short, cryptic, path format (e.g., using
        ``applba~1.def'' instead of ``applbakery.default'').

        Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer to a
        network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the root
        directory cc::// with a subdirectory //wwiinnddoowwss//ssyysstteemm will yield cc::////
        wwiinnddoowwss//ssyysstteemm (two slashes together), which refers to the mount
        point called ssyysstteemm on the machine called wwiinnddoowwss (and the cc::// is
        ignored), and is not equivalent to cc:://wwiinnddoowwss//ssyysstteemm, which describes
        a directory on the current computer. The _ff_ii_ll_ee_ _jj_oo_ii_nn command should be
        used to concatenate path components.

    WWiinnddoowwss NNTT
        When attempting to execute an application, eexxeecc first searches for
        the name as it was specified. Then, in order, ..ccoomm, ..eexxee, and ..bbaatt
        are appended to the end of the specified name and it searches for the
        longer name. If a directory name was not specified as part of the
        application name, the following directories are automatically
        searched in order when attempting to locate the application:


              The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.
              The current directory.
              The Windows NT 32-bit system directory.
              The Windows NT 16-bit system directory.
              The Windows NT home directory.
              The directories listed in the path.


        In order to execute the shell builtin commands like ddiirr and ccooppyy, the
        caller must prepend ``ccmmdd..eexxee //cc'' to the desired command.

    WWiinnddoowwss 9955
        When attempting to execute an application, eexxeecc first searches for
        the name as it was specified. Then, in order, ..ccoomm, ..eexxee, and ..bbaatt
        are appended to the end of the specified name and it searches for the
        longer name. If a directory name was not specified as part of the
        application name, the following directories are automatically
        searched in order when attempting to locate the application:


              The directory from which the Tcl executable was loaded.
              The current directory.
              The Windows 95 system directory.
              The Windows 95 home directory.
              The directories listed in the path.


        In order to execute the shell builtin commands like ddiirr and ccooppyy, the
        caller must prepend ``ccoommmmaanndd..ccoomm //cc'' to the desired command.

        Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input from a console
        and then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit DOS applications will see
        the standard input as already closed. 32-bit applications do not have
        this problem and will run correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS
        application thinks that standard input is closed. There is no known
        workaround for this bug at this time.

        Redirection between the NNUULL:: device and a 16-bit application does not
        always work. When redirecting from NNUULL::, some applications may hang,
        others will get an infinite stream of ``0x01'' bytes, and some will
        actually correctly get an immediate end-of-file; the behavior seems
        to depend upon something compiled into the application itself. When
        redirecting greater than 4K or so to NNUULL::, some applications will
        hang. The above problems do not happen with 32-bit applications.

        All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously. All standard input
        from a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is collected into a temporary
        file; the other end of the pipe must be closed before the 16-bit DOS
        application begins executing. All standard output or error from a 16-
        bit DOS application to a pipe is collected into temporary files; the
        application must terminate before the temporary files are redirected
        to the next stage of the pipeline. This is due to a workaround for a
        Windows 95 bug in the implementation of pipes, and is how the
        standard Windows 95 DOS shell handles pipes itself.

        Certain applications, such as ccoommmmaanndd..ccoomm, should not be executed
        interactively. Applications which directly access the console window,
        rather than reading from their standard input and writing to their
        standard output may fail, hang Tcl, or even hang the system if their
        own private console window is not available to them.
