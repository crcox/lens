  This command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and returns a
  channel identifier that may be used in future invocations of commands like
  _rr_ee_aa_dd, _pp_uu_tt_ss, and _cc_ll_oo_ss_ee. If the first character of fileName is not || then the
  command opens a file: fileName gives the name of the file to open, and it
  must conform to the conventions described in the _ff_ii_ll_ee_nn_aa_mm_ee manual entry.

  The access argument, if present, indicates the way in which the file (or
  command pipeline) is to be accessed. In the first form access may have any
  of the following values:



    rr
        Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is
        the default value if access is not specified.

    rr++
        Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already
        exist.

    ww
        Open the file for writing only. Truncate it if it exists. If it
        doesn't exist, create a new file.

    ww++
        Open the file for reading and writing. Truncate it if it exists. If
        it doesn't exist, create a new file.

    aa
        Open the file for writing only. If the file doesn't exist, create a
        new empty file. Set the initial access position to the end of the
        file.

    aa++
        Open the file for reading and writing. If the file doesn't exist,
        create a new empty file. Set the initial access position to the end
        of the file.


  In the second form, access consists of a list of any of the following
  flags, all of which have the standard POSIX meanings. One of the flags must
  be either RRDDOONNLLYY, WWRROONNLLYY or RRDDWWRR.



    RRDDOONNLLYY
        Open the file for reading only.

    WWRROONNLLYY
        Open the file for writing only.

    RRDDWWRR
        Open the file for both reading and writing.

    AAPPPPEENNDD
        Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.

    CCRREEAATT
        Create the file if it doesn't already exist (without this flag it is
        an error for the file not to exist).

    EEXXCCLL
        If CCRREEAATT is also specified, an error is returned if the file already
        exists.

    NNOOCCTTTTYY
        If the file is a terminal device, this flag prevents the file from
        becoming the controlling terminal of the process.

    NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK
        Prevents the process from blocking while opening the file, and
        possibly in subsequent I/O operations. The exact behavior of this
        flag is system- and device-dependent; its use is discouraged (it is
        better to use the _ff_cc_oo_nn_ff_ii_gg_uu_rr_ee command to put a file in nonblocking
        mode). For details refer to your system documentation on the ooppeenn
        system call's OO__NNOONNBBLLOOCCKK flag.

    TTRRUUNNCC
        If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.


  If a new file is created as part of opening it, permissions (an integer) is
  used to set the permissions for the new file in conjunction with the
  process's file mode creation mask. Permissions defaults to 0666.

  Note that if you are going to be reading or writing binary data from the
  channel created by this command, you should use the _ff_cc_oo_nn_ff_ii_gg_uu_rr_ee command to
  change the --ttrraannssllaattiioonn option of the channel to _bb_ii_nn_aa_rr_yy before transferring
  any binary data. This is in contrast to the ``b'' character passed as part
  of the equivalent of the access parameter to some versions of the C library
  fopen() function.

  If the first character of fileName is ``|'' then the remaining characters
  of fileName are treated as a list of arguments that describe a command
  pipeline to invoke, in the same style as the arguments for _ee_xx_ee_cc. In this
  case, the channel identifier returned by ooppeenn may be used to write to the
  command's input pipe or read from its output pipe, depending on the value
  of access. If write-only access is used (e.g. access is ww), then standard
  output for the pipeline is directed to the current standard output unless
  overridden by the command. If read-only access is used (e.g. access is rr),
  standard input for the pipeline is taken from the current standard input
  unless overridden by the command.

  If fileName refers to a serial port, then the specified serial port is
  opened and initialized in a platform-dependent manner. Acceptable values
  for the fileName to use to open a serial port are described in the
  PORTABILITY ISSUES section.

  The _ff_cc_oo_nn_ff_ii_gg_uu_rr_ee command can be used to query and set the following
  configuration option for open serial ports:



    --mmooddeebaud,,parity,,data,,stop
        This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate,
        parity, number of data bits, and number of stop bits for this serial
        port. The baud rate is a simple integer that specifies the connection
        speed. Parity is one of the following letters: nn, oo, ee, mm, ss;
        respectively signifying the parity options of ``none'', ``odd'',
        ``even'', ``mark'', or ``space''. Data is the number of data bits and
        should be an integer from 5 to 8, while stop is the number of stop
        bits and should be the integer 1 or 2.

    --ppoolllliinntteerrvvaallmsec
        This option, available only on Windows for serial ports, is used to
        set the maximum time between polling for fileevents. This affects the
        time interval between checking for events throughout the Tcl
        interpreter (the smallest value always wins). Use this option only if
        you want to poll the serial port more often than 10 msec (the
        default).

    --llaasstteerrrroorr
        This option is available only on Windows for serial ports, and is
        query only (will only be reported when directly requested). In case
        of a serial communication error, _rr_ee_aa_dd or _pp_uu_tt_ss returns a general Tcl
        file I/O error. ffccoonnffiigguurree --llaasstteerrrroorr can be called to get a list of
        error details (e.g. FRAME RXOVER).

        Valid values for fileName to open a serial port are of the form
        ccoommX::, where X is a number, generally from 1 to 4. This notation only
        works for serial ports from 1 to 9, if the system happens to have
        more than four. An attempt to open a serial port that does not exist
        or has a number greater than 9 will fail. An alternate form of
        opening serial ports is to use the filename \\\\..\\ccoommXX, where X is any
        number that corresponds to a serial port; please note that this
        method is considerably slower on Windows 95 and Windows 98.

        When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange
        interactions between the real console, if one is present, and a
        command pipeline that uses standard input or output. If a command
        pipeline is opened for reading, some of the lines entered at the
        console will be sent to the command pipeline and some will be sent to
        the Tcl evaluator. If a command pipeline is opened for writing,
        keystrokes entered into the console are not visible until the the
        pipe is closed. This behavior occurs whether the command pipeline is
        executing 16-bit or 32-bit applications. These problems only occur
        because both Tcl and the child application are competing for the
        console at the same time. If the command pipeline is started from a
        script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the command
        pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is redirected
        from or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.

    WWiinnddoowwss 9955
        A command pipeline that executes a 16-bit DOS application cannot be
        opened for both reading and writing, since 16-bit DOS applications
        that receive standard input from a pipe and send standard output to a
        pipe run synchronously. Command pipelines that do not execute 16-bit
        DOS applications run asynchronously and can be opened for both
        reading and writing.

        When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange
        interactions between the real console, if one is present, and a
        command pipeline that uses standard input or output. If a command
        pipeline is opened for reading from a 32-bit application, some of the
        keystrokes entered at the console will be sent to the command
        pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator. If a command
        pipeline is opened for writing to a 32-bit application, no output is
        visible on the console until the the pipe is closed. These problems
        only occur because both Tcl and the child application are competing
        for the console at the same time. If the command pipeline is started
        from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console, or if the
        command pipeline does not use standard input or output, but is
        redirected from or to a file, then the above problems do not occur.

        Whether or not Tcl is running interactively, if a command pipeline is
        opened for reading from a 16-bit DOS application, the call to ooppeenn
        will not return until end-of-file has been received from the command
        pipeline's standard output. If a command pipeline is opened for
        writing to a 16-bit DOS application, no data will be sent to the
        command pipeline's standard output until the pipe is actually closed.
        This problem occurs because 16-bit DOS applications are run
        synchronously, as described above.

        Opening a serial port is not currently implemented under Macintosh.

        Opening a command pipeline is not supported under Macintosh, since
        applications do not support the concept of standard input or output.

    UUnniixx
        Valid values for fileName to open a serial port are generally of the
        form //ddeevv//ttttyyX, where X is aa or bb, but the name of any pseudo-file
        that maps to a serial port may be used.

        When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange
        interactions between the console, if one is present, and a command
        pipeline that uses standard input. If a command pipeline is opened
        for reading, some of the lines entered at the console will be sent to
        the command pipeline and some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator. This
        problem only occurs because both Tcl and the child application are
        competing for the console at the same time. If the command pipeline
        is started from a script, so that Tcl is not accessing the console,
        or if the command pipeline does not use standard input, but is
        redirected from a file, then the above problem does not occur.
